YEARBOOK MUGS READER

This project, built for use by the BCI yearbook team, allows quick and easy spellchecking of student names
by comparing inputs to a selected index file. Inputs can be in a variety of formats.
Currently supported formats include comma-separated, whitespace/newline separated, mugs page format,
and clubs/sports page format. The program will search the contents of the selected index file for a match
against all names provided, and report which ones found no match. Names that were successfully matched
can report additional information, such as grade and homeform class.

The main purpose of the program is to identify spelling errors among the names in a list, and to look up
additional data when required for management purposes like distribution. Having this program negates the
need to manually search through the index file hundreds of times to find where names have been spelled wrong
in mugs pages, clubs/sports sections, and grads sections. This streamlining the editing process and reduces
the number of spelling errors in the final product.

See instructions panel in the GUI for more information on functions provided.

This project is written in Java and may require a Java IDE to run, such as Java RTP. Alternatively it can be
run from command line using only a Java compiler such as javac, and a virtual machine. To run the program
from an IDE, open and compile class MugsReader and run. See instructions panel in the GUI for instructions
on running from a command line.

The program also requires at least one index file to operate on. These files are packaged along with
student/staff mugshots and tend to become available in January. Index files from some past years are included
as a start. However, these sample index files may no longer represent the school's population.
